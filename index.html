	<p>Post 1:<h1>The first day...</h1>Well today had been  good day with my cousin sister's birthday but driving there took almost a whole hour!! but I managed To Survive and when we reached there we had a lot of fun there. welp this is more like an E-Diary than a blog so lets make the title the same.<br /> ok so good news! (BTW it is me from the future here) and the good news is that the whole birthday party went very well and surely not a flop.</p>
